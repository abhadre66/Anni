        Happy Anniversary to the most special person in my life.
        It’s been a year of us a year of love, memories, laughter, and growing together,
        and I know this is just the beginning, with many more beautiful years to come.
    
        I still remember the very first day you said “I love you” to me.
        Even though you said you were kidding, my heart knew it meant something more.
        It was on <span class="glow-date">4th of February, around 7:30 PM</span> 
        a moment I will never forget.
    
        And then, on this very day last year, you said it again this time for real.
    
        <span class="final-line">
          From that moment on, every second with you became my favorite memory.
          I love you more and more every single day 💫
        </span>
